## 2021 Roadmap to Web3 and Smart Contracts development with Solidity.

As a Web3.0 developer, you need to understand **what the Blockchain** is, how it works and why it might disrupt the way we exchange goods and make payments.
Blockchain technology is no more related only to crypto coins but it has become a truly distributed cloud computing system capable of running full Backends to power cutting edge Decentralized Applications (DApps).

The applications built on top of Blockchain are called **Decentralized applications, or DApps**, and have:

-   **A standard Front-end** built using JavaScript or frameworks/libraries like React, Vue, Svelte, and so on.
-   **A Solidity/Solana/Rust backend**, built on top of the blockchain.

Learn:

-   HTML, JavaScript, React
-   Blockchain fundamentals
-   What are Ethereum and Smart Contracts
-   Solidity
-   Web3.js or Ethers.js
-   Truffle/Ganache
-   Testing
